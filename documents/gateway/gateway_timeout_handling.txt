Timeouts
How does the Gateway handle timeouts?
The Gateway implements a configurable timeout when making a request to the downstream/backend service. By default, this timeout is 5 seconds. If the http response from the backend is not recieved to Gateway before the timeout, then the Gateway returns an HTTP 504 error.

Note
The "Timeout" setting under "Target" in MyGateway UI sets the socketTimeout in the yaml configuration. API Gateway sets the request timeout (Jetty Timeout) twice the socketTimeout.
For example: if the "Timeout" is set to 1000ms, Gateway sets the request timeout as 2000ms. As a result, the svcTime could be greater than the socketTimeout defined under "Target" settings and so, the allowed the request would take longer than the socketTimeout.
