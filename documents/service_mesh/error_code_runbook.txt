1. If you receive 401 status code when service mesh log event is destination or source
    - If the msg is "via_upstream" or "Response Generated by Acropolis", indicates that the client service is not connected to destination service.
        - Please verify if teh calling service is connected to destination service on dev portal for the required environment.
        - In case you need further assitence, please reach out to https://devportal.intuit.com/app/dp/capability/3202/capabilityDocs/main/docs/support/support.md mesh team

2. status code= 429 and event=source
    - If msg contains "response from client backoff filter"
        - This request was throttled due to backoff settings applied on the client side. Please check the throttle config on the client.
    - If msg contains "via_upstream"
        - Please check the destination event log entry for the failure reason.

3. status code = 429 and event=destination
    - If msg contains any of "ResponseGeneratedByPreAuthFilter", "ResponseGeneratedByFastThrottleFilter", "ResponseGeneratedByAppThrottleFilter"
        - This request was throttled due to service config. Please see if throttle configuration needs to be tweaked for destination service

4. In case of 429 errors -
    1. User needs to check the service throttle configuration.
    2. If they need to send higher TPS, they can check with service team.
    3. If they believe they were incorrectly throttled, they should reach out to the mesh team to figure why.

5. In case of 500 errors
    - If the event is source and msg is "via_upstream"
        - If response_flags is URX,
            - Client was unable to reach to service
            - URX indicates that there was connection failure even after multiple retries.
            - Please check the events on the service during this time. If nothing changed, chedck with service mesh team (https://devportal.intuit.com/app/dp/capability/3202/capabilityDocs/main/docs/support/support.md).
        - If response_flag is anything other than URX
            - Please check the destination event log entry for the failure reason.

6. status as 503 on source event
    - If response_flags is NC
        - NC: Upstream cluster not found.
        - This means that istio sidecar was not able to find the entity where it needs to rout the request.
        - Take a look at Istio custom resources such as VirtualService, DestinationRule etc. defined on the service namespace.
        - Make sure the configuration is correct. Small errors like mismatch in label names can cause such issues.
        - If you believe the configuration is correct, please seek help from Service Mesh Team.
    - If response_flgas is UH
        - UH: No healthy upstream hosts in upstream cluster.
        - This means that envoy was not able to find any healthy destination target.
        - Please check the destination workloads and make sure they are healthy and that the routing rules are correctly configured
    - If response_flags is URX
        - URX: The request was rejected because the upstream retry limit (HTTP) or maximum connect attempts (TCP) was reached
    - If response_flags is UF
        - UF: Upstream connection failure. Source service was not able to establish connection with destination service.
    - If response_flags is UO
        - UO: Upstream overflow (circuit breaking). The source service was overwhelmed during this time due to which circuit breaker was triggered.

6. status as 503 on destination event
    - If response_flags is UC
        - UC: Upstream connection failure.
        - This means that envoy was not able to connect to the upstream cluster.
        - Please check the destination workloads and make sure they are healthy and that the service is listening on the port that envoy is trying to connect to.
        - If you believe the configuration is correct, please seek help from Service Mesh Team (https://devportal.intuit.com/app/dp/capability/3202/capabilityDocs/main/docs/support/support.md)
    - If response_flgas is UH
        - UH: No healthy upstream hosts in upstream cluster.
        - This means that envoy was not able to find any healthy destination target.
        - Please check the destination workloads and make sure they are healthy.
        - If you believe the configuration is correct, please seek help from Service Mesh Team (https://devportal.intuit.com/app/dp/capability/3202/capabilityDocs/main/docs/support/support.md)
    - If response_flags is UF
       - UF: Upstream connection failure or remote reset.
       - This means that envoy was not able to connect to the upstream cluster. Please check the destination service workloads and make sure they are healthy and that the service is listening on the port that envoy is trying to connect to.
       - If you believe the configuration is correct, please seek help from Service Mesh Team (https://devportal.intuit.com/app/dp/capability/3202/capabilityDocs/main/docs/support/support.md)
    - If response_flags is DC
        - DC: downstream connection termination.
        - This means that the downstream connection was terminated by the client.
        - Please check the client service logs for the reason.
        - If you believe that the client is not at fault, please seek help from Service Mesh Team (https://devportal.intuit.com/app/dp/capability/3202/capabilityDocs/main/docs/support/support.md)

7. status as 0
    - If response_flags is DC, indicates that the downstream client service disconnected. Destination service did not start sending the response.
